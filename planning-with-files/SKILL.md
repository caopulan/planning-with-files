description: Transforms workflow to use Manus-style persistent markdown files for planning, progress tracking, and knowledge storage. Use when starting complex tasks, multi-step projects, research tasks, or when the user mentions planning, organizing work, tracking progress, or wants structured output.

# Planning with Files

Work like Manus: Use persistent markdown files as your "working memory on disk."

## Before You Start

1. Create `agent_planning_with_files_cache/` in the working directory.
2. If `.gitignore` exists, add `agent_planning_with_files_cache/`.
3. Create a task subdirectory inside it, named: `<YYYYMMDD>-<HHMM>-<short-task>`.
   - Keep `short-task` brief and hyphenated.
4. Store `task_plan.md`, `notes.md`, and `[deliverable].md` inside that task directory.

## Quick Start

Before ANY complex task:

1. **Create `task_plan.md`** in the task directory
2. **Define phases** with checkboxes
3. **Update after each phase** - mark [x] and change status
4. **Read before deciding** - refresh goals in attention window

## The 3-File Pattern

For every non-trivial task, create THREE files:

| File | Purpose | When to Update |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `task_plan.md` | Track phases and progress | After each phase |
| `notes.md` | Store findings and research | During research |
| `[deliverable].md` | Final output | At completion |

All files live in the task directory.

## Core Workflow

Assume `TASK_DIR=agent_planning_with_files_cache/20250103-0930-short-task`.

```
Loop 1: Create task_plan.md in TASK_DIR with goal and phases
Loop 2: Research → save to notes.md → update task_plan.md
Loop 3: Read notes.md → create deliverable → update task_plan.md
Loop 4: Deliver final output
```

### The Loop in Detail

**Before each major action:**
```bash
Read TASK_DIR/task_plan.md  # Refresh goals in attention window
```

**After each phase:**
```bash
Edit TASK_DIR/task_plan.md  # Mark [x], update status
```

**When storing information:**
```bash
Write TASK_DIR/notes.md     # Don't stuff context, store in file
```

## task_plan.md Template

Create this file FIRST for any complex task (in `TASK_DIR/task_plan.md`):

```markdown
# Task Plan: [Brief Description]

## Goal
[One sentence describing the end state]

## Phases
- [ ] Phase 1: Plan and setup
- [ ] Phase 2: Research/gather information
- [ ] Phase 3: Execute/build
- [ ] Phase 4: Review and deliver

## Key Questions
1. [Question to answer]
2. [Question to answer]

## Decisions Made
- [Decision]: [Rationale]

## Errors Encountered
- [Error]: [Resolution]

## Status
**Currently in Phase X** - [What I'm doing now]
```

## notes.md Template

For research and findings (in `TASK_DIR/notes.md`):

```markdown
# Notes: [Topic]

## Sources

### Source 1: [Name]
- URL: [link]
- Key points:
  - [Finding]
  - [Finding]

## Synthesized Findings

### [Category]
- [Finding]
- [Finding]
```

## Critical Rules

### 1. ALWAYS Create Plan First
Never start a complex task without `task_plan.md`. This is non-negotiable.

### 2. Read Before Decide
Before any major decision, read the plan file. This keeps goals in your attention window.

### 3. Update After Act
After completing any phase, immediately update the plan file:
- Mark completed phases with [x]
- Update the Status section
- Log any errors encountered

### 4. Store, Don't Stuff
Large outputs go to files, not context. Keep only paths in working memory.

### 5. Log All Errors
Every error goes in the "Errors Encountered" section. This builds knowledge for future tasks.

### 6. Keep Everything in the Task Directory
Plans, notes, and deliverables must live under the current task directory.

## When to Use This Pattern

**Use 3-file pattern for:**
- Multi-step tasks (3+ steps)
- Research tasks
- Building/creating something
- Tasks spanning multiple tool calls
- Anything requiring organization

**Skip for:**
- Simple questions
- Single-file edits
- Quick lookups

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Don't | Do Instead |
|-------|------------|
| Use TodoWrite for persistence | Create `task_plan.md` file |
| State goals once and forget | Re-read plan before each decision |
| Hide errors and retry | Log errors to plan file |
| Stuff everything in context | Store large content in files |
| Start executing immediately | Create plan file FIRST |
| Scatter task files in the repo root | Keep them in the task directory |
